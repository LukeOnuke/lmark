- A dot is added
- The file gets closed or swiched
- The program closes

Autosave can of course be disabled if you like to live life on the edge.

## Options
There arent that many customisation options but you can find (almost) all of them in the settings menu *(to navigate to it go to `Options > Settings`)*. The options you selected are also autosaved when you close the settings window.

If you truly want to edit them by hand all settings are saved in the `app.properties` file located in the program directory. You can navigate to the program dirrectory using the `Options > Open program folder` menu.

## Dark / Light mode
By default dark mode is synched with the system, but you can disable sync or chose the mode yourself it in the [options](#options).

## Exporting markdown documents
To export your markdown document go to `File > Save As` and pick your filetype of choice.

## Open (the welcome window)
The open window is the first window you see when you launch lmark by itself. From there you can open and create files.

When you open a document the edit window will launch without you seeing the open window.
